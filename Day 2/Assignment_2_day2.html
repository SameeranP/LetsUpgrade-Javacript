    <h1>Examples of JavaScript String functions:</h1>
    <script src="Assignment_2_day2.js"></script>
    <p>1. charAt(x): Returns the character at the “x” position within the string.<br>
    2. concat(v1, v2,…): Combines one or more strings (arguments v1, v2 etc) into the existing one and returns the combined string. Original string is not modified.<br>
    3. indexOf(substr, [start]): Searches and (if found) returns the index number of the searched character or substring within the string. If not found, -1 is returned. “Start” is an optional argument specifying the position within string to begin the search. Default is 0.<br>
    4. lastIndexOf(substr, [start]): Searches and (if found) returns the index number of the searched character or substring within the string. Searches the string from end to beginning. If not found, -1 is returned. “Start” is an optional argument specifying the position within string to begin the search. Default is string.length-1.<br>
    5. substring(from, [to]): Returns the characters in a string between “from” and “to” indexes, NOT including “to” inself. “To” is optional, and if omitted, up to the end of the string is assumed.<br>
    6. toLowerCase(): Returns the string with all of its characters converted to lowercase.<br>
    7. toUpperCase(): Returns the string with all of its characters converted to uppercase.<br>
    8. replace(regexp/substr, replacetext): Searches and replaces the regular expression (or sub string) portion (match) with the replaced text instead.<br>
    9. slice(start, [end]): Returns a substring of the string based on the “start” and “end” index arguments, NOT including the “end” index itself. “End” is optional, and if none is specified, the slice includes all characters from “start” to end of string.<br>
    10.split(delimiter, [limit]): Splits a string into many according to the specified delimiter, and returns an array containing each element. The optional “limit” is an integer that lets you specify the maximum number of elements to return.<br>

<h1>Examples of JS Array Methods:</h1>
<p>
1. Array.push() : Adding Element at the end of an Array. As array in JavaScript are mutable object, we can easily add or remove elements from the Array. And it dynamically changes as we modify the elements from the array.<br>
2. Array.unshift() : Adding elements at the front of an Array<br>
3. Array.pop() : Removing elements from the end of an array<br>
4. Array.shift() : Removing elements at the beginning of an array<br>
5. Array.splice() : Insertion and Removal in between an Array<br>
