    Using "var" you can create a new variable which can be changed at any point of time.
    Its not safe to use this when you don't want the variable altered by mistake i  the 
    due course of writing the code. Hence we have other means of declaring variables.<br>
    <br>
    Using "const" to declare a variable is another available way
    But once the variable is declared usig this keyword, it cannot be changed.
    Althogh if the object stored in the variable is mutable, like an 
    array for instance, then it can be mutated, but still you cannot 
    redeclare the variable and assign another value to it, it'll throw an error.
    <br>
    Doing this can throw an error:<br>
    const id_num = 11810951;<br>
    console.log(id_num);<br>
    id_num = 1210091;<br>
    console.log(id_num); <br><br>
    or<br>
    
const fruits = ["apple","banana","grapes"]<br>
console.log(fruits)<br>
fruits.push("orange")<br>
console.log(fruits) // This is allowed<br>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "chikoo"] //But this will throw an error<br>
<br>
Another way of declaring variable is is using the keyword
"let". let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. The other difference between var and let is that the latter is initialized to a value only when a parser evaluates it.

Just like const the let does not create properties of the window object when declared globally (in the top-most scope).
<br>
Example:<br>
var city = "Delhi" <br>

{<br>
let city = "Nagpur"<br>
console.log(city)<br>

}<br>
console.log(city)<br>
here city name was not changed outside the scope, and remained
"Delhi".
